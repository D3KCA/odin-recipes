# odin-recipes
HTML project for The Odin Project Curriculum.

The current project is Recipes from the introduction it look like the skill that I will have demonstrated to complete is the HTML boilerplate, linking a few recipes connecting images and some other skills aquired from previous lessons.

Update Post project
This project was fun creating the odin-recipes pages used a lot of list ordered and unordered great practice, and also using the img src alt elements for the images. Got to go back over connecting the pages from the index page and other HTML boilerplate.
