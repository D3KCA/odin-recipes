      alt="The image depicts a fun and casual dish known as taco in a bag or
    walking tacos. Three small bags of Fritos corn chips are open at the top,
    with taco toppings layered inside. Each bag is filled with shredded cheddar
    cheese, sour cream, and possibly seasoned ground beef or chili sauce. The
    bags are placed in a metal holder to keep them upright. On the plate below,
    there are additional toppings like sliced jalapeños, halved cherry tomatoes,
    shredded lettuce, and possibly some pickled vegetables. Several plastic
    forks are laid out, ready to be used for eating straight from the bags. The
    presentation is casual and fun, perfect for gatherings or a quick,
    customizable meal. The bright orange cloth in the background adds a pop of
    color to the scene."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>3/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
      <li>4 (2.5 ounce) packages corn chips</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 chopped fresh tomato</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>⅓ cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <li>
        Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until
        browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess oil. Mix in water and
        taco seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5
        minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Gently crush corn chips in the sealed bags. Snip one top and one bottom
        corner off each bag, then cut open along the side edge. Spoon equal
        amounts of beef, lettuce, Cheddar, tomato, sour cream, and salsa into
        each bag on top of crushed chips. Serve in the bag and eat using a fork.
