    The image shows a homemade pizza in a cast iron skillet. The pizza has a golden-brown crust with a slightly thick and uneven edge, indicating it might be hand-pressed. The toppings include diced tomatoes, cheese, and what appears to be fresh herbs, possibly basil or parsley. The cheese has melted evenly, creating a bubbling effect, and the herbs are scattered across the top, giving the pizza a rustic, fresh-from-the-oven appearance. The cast iron skillet adds a nice crispy texture to the crust, which is common in skillet pizzas. The pizza is set on a stove burner, likely fresh out of the oven or cooked on the stove."

    <p>
      Baked in a cast iron skillet, this deep-dish pizza has a buttery, thick,
      and chewy pizza crust. The toppings are substantial but not so
      overwhelming that the dough won't cook. If you cook the sausage while the
      dough is proofing, you'll be ready to assemble the pizza that much faster.
      This pairs perfectly with a Caesar salad. Pizza never tasted so good!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>⅓ cup bulk pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 (3.5 ounce) Italian sausage link</li>
      <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>24 slices pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted (Optional)</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon Italian seasoning (Optional)</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!-- used the <p></p> as spacing between list items to make easy read. -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sprinkle yeast and brown sugar over warm water in the bowl of a stand
        mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes, or until
        the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Turn the mixer to the lowest setting and slowly add 2 cups flour, 1/2
        cup at a time. Add 1/4 cup butter and garlic salt, then slowly add the
        remaining 2 cups flour and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to
        7 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Coat a large glass bowl with 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil. Shape dough
        into a ball and place into the bowl, turning to coat all sides with oil.
        Spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray place over the bowl,
        oiled-side down. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm area
        until dough has doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. Punch down the
        dough and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        After punching down the dough, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add bulk
        sausage and cook until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Use a
        slotted spoon to transfer cooked sausage to a bowl, retaining drippings
        in the skillet.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Add sausage link to the drippings and cook until browned and no longer
        pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Slice
        sausage.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch cast
        iron skillet with the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Press dough into and up the sides of the prepared skillet. Poke holes in
        dough with a fork to prevent air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce around the
        base of the crust. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese over sauce,
        then layer with 1/2 of the bulk sausage, 1/2 of the sliced sausage, and
        1/2 of the pepperoni. Repeat the meat layers once more, then top with
        the remaining mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Bake on the bottom rack of the preheated oven until the crust is golden
        brown, about 25 minutes. Brush crust with melted butter, then season
        with Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Remove pizza from the skillet
        and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
